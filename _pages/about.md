I am an undergraduate researcher at the [Visual Science Lab](https://vslab.khu.ac.kr/), Kyung Hee University, supervised by **Prof. MyeongAh Cho**. My research interests lie in **robust and efficient 3D perception systems** for intelligent robots — including **3D scene representation**, **scene graph prediction**, and **language-guided navigation**.

Since 2019, I have explored a broad range of software development areas, from **deep learning–based applications** to **end-to-end DL service deployment systems**, and have led several interdisciplinary projects successfully.  

Currently, I am focusing on building **object-centric 3D scene understanding frameworks** (such as *3D scene graphs* and *3D Gaussian Splatting*) to bridge perception and planning for embodied intelligence.
